# Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)

RAPs are essential practice to ensure we produce robust and reliable statistics and outputs. RAPs bring good practice into our work and bring them to a higher standard.

In DHSC we have a variety of tools to help develop and implement RAPs into your work. This document aims to familiarise yourself these tools and fundamentals to RAP.

Over the book we will build a very simple RAP from start to finish using R.

## What makes a good RAP?

**Code**

- Analysis is produced using an open-source language such as R
- Outputs should require minimal if no manual intervention
- Code is well documented such as using function descriptions
- Code is well organised and structured folders
- Has undergone an appropriate QA (quality assurance)
- Code uses appropriate coding standards (Tidy style guide in DHSC)
- Pipeline included unit testing
- Fully packaged

**Data / Pipeline**

- Data should be handled in tidy format
- Data should come from a managed source such as a database
- Repo uses CI/CD and runs tests

**Documentation**

- Code produces informative and useful logging (for troubleshooting and to ensure RAP has run correctly)
- Code is version controlled using Git
- Clear documentation for future users (e.g. READMEs)
- Published
- Changes to RAP is clearly documented and signposted (change log)


Not all RAPs will include all of the above, but we should aspire to meet as much as possible and appropriate. We will cover the majority of the above in this book.
