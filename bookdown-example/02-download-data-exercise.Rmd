# Exercise

In this section, you'll perform your own analysis on a new dataset, which can be taken forward to use in your RAP project.

Please complete the following tasks:

1. Update the data_id parameter in config.yml: look at the data dictionary and choose any data_id you want

2. Get the url for the latest version of the file with you chosen data_id

3. Download this file

4. Produce some summary stats and write the file to a .csv in the output folder.

5 Test that the error processing works by adding a nonsense URL, either in the config file, or add it to your code
