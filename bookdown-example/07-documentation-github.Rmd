# Adding your project to Github

Now you have a project of files, it is useful to add this to Github for collaboration.

To do this, we can follow the steps in the howto.qmd file in your repository.

Once you have your initial setup done, you should configure git with your Github username and email.

You should make a commit of the current version of the project by using Git>Commit in RStudio. Make sure to add a comment, such as "initial commit". 

Now, you can run the snippet of code under the header "Adding GitHub support", which will generate a private Github repository in the DHSC organisation.
