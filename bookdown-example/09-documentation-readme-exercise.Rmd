# Exercise

In this section, you'll create a readme file for your project.

Open the README.Rmd file in your project's root directory and add the following:

1. Short statement of intent
2. Longer description describing the problem that your project solves and how it solves it
3. Basic installation instructions or link to installation guide
4. Example usage
5. Screenshot if your project has a graphical user interface (but make sure to mask any data if it is not in the public domain)
6. Links to related projects 

Knit the Rmd file and review the results.
